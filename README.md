# Template streamlit app 

This repository contains a template for creating streamlit apps. It already has separate pages, separate text files for writing markdown on those pages, and a few examples of functions split off into different files. 

The default page topics follow the recommendations of Tom Monks and Alison Harper (in Proceedings of the Operational Research Society Simulation Workshop 2023 (SW23)).
