## Summary

Give a short summary of what the app does here. You could also include some links that contain more information than there's space for here. 


## Background information 

It's worth having a quick overview of what the app is about, if it's not obvious. 

We're looking at how 

+ input 1 
+ input 2 and
+ input 3

affect the output. 

Emoji can be written too. For :ambulance: the `:ambulance:` format can be used in markdown, and the `\U0001f691` format can be used in streamlit input labels. 


## How to use this app

Go to the "Interactive demo" in the left sidebar.
There you can change **the input parameters** to see the resulting effect on **the output**.

To change between light mode and dark mode or to make the display wider, change the settings under the Menu in the top right of the screen.
