# Citation 

Please cite this model as: 

    @software{your_reference_here,
        author       = {Me, I and Myself, I},
        title        = {template\_app Streamlit app v1.0.0},
        month        = nov,
        year         = 2022,
        publisher    = {Zenodo},
        version      = {v1.0.0},
        doi          = {your DOI here},
        url          = {DOI URL here}
	}
	
To make a Zenodo citation, follow the instructions on this link: [https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/archiving-a-github-repository/referencing-and-citing-content](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/archiving-a-github-repository/referencing-and-citing-content)

There are some parts that you then have to do manually by editing the record on Zenodo. For example, the authors and licence won't copy over from GitHub. 
	
On the Zenodo website, you can also copy a markdown badge to use as a link for a DOI.
Here is a badge for another streamlit app: 
[![DOI](https://zenodo.org/badge/536700822.svg)](https://zenodo.org/badge/latestdoi/536700822)
